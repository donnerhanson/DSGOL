Comments about Game of Life solution:

    I would like to implement a way to have only one "Run()" function in the future. 

  Also my original plan was to have an inheritance heirarchy set up but encountered multiple issues with orientation/calculation/drawing
during the Run function. 

Wanted to have a base class map with a calculate function and have donut and mirror inherit but was running into multiD inheritance issues.
Will have to revisit to see if it would cut down on code or if it would even make a difference.
